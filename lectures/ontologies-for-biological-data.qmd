## Learning objectives

-   **find** an ontology and **assess** its validity
-   **name** at least two widely used ontologies in the life sciences
-   **use** tools to look-up and annotate terms

## Ontologies Tools

Many online tools to **find** and **use** ontologies!

1.  How to list and find ontologies?
2.  How to search ontology terms?
3.  How to annotate list of terms?

## Find ontologies

From the general to the specific:

-   [~~OntoBee~~](https://ontobee.org) ~~is more targeted to developers~~

-   [NCBO BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/) has mostly biomedical ontologies

-   [Ontology Lookup Service v4](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4)

-   [The OBO Foundry](http://obofoundry.org)

## Ontology Lookup Service

> OLS is the official ontology service of the EMBL-EBI
>
> <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4>

-   EMBL: European Molecular Biology Laboratory

-   EMBL-EBI: EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute

## The OBO Foundry

> is a **community** of Open Biology and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) that share principles and practices
>
> <https://obofoundry.org>

### OBO ontologies

-   are used by many and maintained ~~by few~~.

-   have non-overlapping terms in relation with others ontologies

-   are responsive to changes by the scientific community

## Selecting ontology

A usable and reliable ontology

::: incremental
-   [x] has sound terms definitions that you agree with
-   [x] is actively developed and updated to reflect the scientific practices
-   [x] has a community space to exchange with the community (tickets, issues)
-   [x] has an adequate license and appropriate funding (for maintenance)

# Your turn!

## Exercise: Ontology look-up

**Task** using <http://obofoundry.org>

-   **Look-up** 1-2 ontologies that match your field or interests:
    -   by typing keywords into the search bar
    -   or using the *Ontology Domains* menu
-   **Report** them on the pad and compare with your neighbor
-   **Assess** if the ontology matches the quality criteria

. . .

(optional) List the *dependencies* of the ontology and the one of your neighbor

## Example ENVO (1/2) {visibility="hidden"}

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    ENVO -->|depends on| ChEBI 
    ENVO --> FoodOn 
    ENVO --> GO
    ENVO --> NCBITaxon 
    ENVO --> PCO 
    ENVO --> PO
    ENVO --> RO
    ENVO --> UBERON
```

## Example ENVO (2/2) {visibility="hidden"}

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    ENVO -->|depends on| ChEBI 
    ENVO --> FoodOn 
    ENVO --> GO
    ENVO --> NCBITaxon 
    ENVO --> PCO 
    ENVO --> PO
    ENVO --> RO
    ENVO --> UBERON
    GO -->|depends on| NCBITaxon
    GO --> RO
    GO --> UBERON
    GO --> CL
```

## Search terms in ontologies

You can find terms in ontologies using the search bar of:

-   [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/)

-   [Ontology Lookup Service v4](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4)

::: r-stack

![](images/NCBOBioPortal_search.png){.fragment fig-alt="NCBO BioPortal search screenshot" fig-align="center"}
:::

## Annotate list of terms

Such tools are called [annotators]{.orange} and are provided by the two ontology browsers we used:

-   BioPortal has [Annotator](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/annotator)

-   OLS has [ZOOMA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma/)
