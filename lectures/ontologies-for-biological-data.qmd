## Learning objectives

-   **find** an ontology and **assess** its validity
-   **name** at least two widely used ontologies in the life sciences
-   **use** tools to look-up and annotate terms

<!--# Should we demonstrate how to use the hierarchy feature of OLS? -->

## Ontologies Tools

Many online tools to **find** and **use** ontologies!

1.  How to list and find ontologies?
2.  How to search ontology terms?
3.  How to annotate list of terms?

# Find ontologies

## Find ontologies

From the general to the specific:

-   [~~OntoBee~~](https://ontobee.org) ~~is more targeted to developers~~

-   [NCBO BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/) has mostly biomedical ontologies

-   [Ontology Lookup Service v4](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4)

-   [The OBO Foundry](http://obofoundry.org)

## Ontology Lookup Service

> OLS is the official ontology service of the EMBL-EBI
>
> <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4>

-   EMBL: European Molecular Biology Laboratory

-   EMBL-EBI: EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute

## The OBO Foundry

> is a **community** of Open Biology and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) that share principles and practices
>
> <https://obofoundry.org>

### OBO ontologies

-   are used by many and maintained ~~by few~~.

-   have non-overlapping terms in relation with others ontologies

-   are responsive to changes by the scientific community

## Selecting ontology

A usable and reliable ontology

::: incremental
-   [x] has sound terms definitions that you agree with
-   [x] is actively developed and updated to reflect the scientific practices
-   [x] has a community space to exchange with the community (tickets, issues)
-   [x] has an adequate license and appropriate funding (for maintenance)

## Exercise: Ontology look-up

**Task** using <http://obofoundry.org>

-   **Look-up** 1-2 ontologies that match your field or interests:
    -   by typing keywords into the search bar
    -   or using the *Ontology Domains* menu
-   **Report** them on the pad and compare with your neighbor
-   **Assess** if the ontology matches the quality criteria

. . .

(optional) List the *dependencies* of the ontology and the one of your neighbor

## Example ENVO (1/2) {visibility="hidden"}

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    ENVO -->|depends on| ChEBI 
    ENVO --> FoodOn 
    ENVO --> GO
    ENVO --> NCBITaxon 
    ENVO --> PCO 
    ENVO --> PO
    ENVO --> RO
    ENVO --> UBERON
```

## Example ENVO (2/2) {visibility="hidden"}

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    ENVO -->|depends on| ChEBI 
    ENVO --> FoodOn 
    ENVO --> GO
    ENVO --> NCBITaxon 
    ENVO --> PCO 
    ENVO --> PO
    ENVO --> RO
    ENVO --> UBERON
    GO -->|depends on| NCBITaxon
    GO --> RO
    GO --> UBERON
    GO --> CL
```

# Search ontology terms

## Search terms in ontologies

You can find terms in ontologies using the search bar of:

-   [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/)

-   [Ontology Lookup Service v4](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4)

::: r-stack

![](images/NCBOBioPortal_search.png){.fragment fig-alt="NCBO BioPortal search screenshot" fig-align="center"}

## Exercise: Ontology browser {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Task**: using [Ontology Lookup Service v4](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4)

::: incremental
-   **Look-up** the following keywords in that order via the search bar*:* [pond]{.orange}, [ear]{.orange} and [leaf]{.orange}

-   **Select** a term for each using these ontologies:

    -   Uber-anatomy ontology (UBERON)

    -   Plant Ontology (PO)

    -   Environmental Ontology (ENVO)

-   **Report** the term and the term identifier in the pad

::: notes
-   [pond \[ENVO:00000033\]](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/envo/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FENVO_00000033) (the correct term is not far down the list)

-   [ear \[UBERON:0001690\]](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FUBERON_0001690) (many "early" that can be filtered with the exact match option)

-   [leaf \[PO:0025034\]](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/po/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FPO_0025034) (tricky because it is an imported term)
:::

## Exercise: visualize features

::: incremental
-   **Navigate** to 1-2 of the following terms:

    -   [pond \[ENVO:00000033\]](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/envo/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FENVO_00000033)

    -   [ear \[UBERON:0001690\]](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FUBERON_0001690)

    -   [leaf \[PO:0025034\]](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/po/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FPO_0025034)

-   **Inspect** the term page

-   **Associate** parts of the OLS interface with the [expected features of an ontology](https://clavellab.pages.rwth-aachen.de/workshop-biometadata-01/lectures/a-guide-to-metadata-and-ontologies.html#/ontology-definition)
:::

::: notes
Restitution can be made with everyone closer to the screen displaying one of the terms and pointing to each of the ontology features.
:::

# Annotate many terms

## Annotate list of terms

Such tools are called [annotators]{.orange} and are provided by the two ontology browsers we used:

-   BioPortal has [Annotator](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/annotator)

-   OLS has [ZOOMA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma/)
