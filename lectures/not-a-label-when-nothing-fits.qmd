## An edge case

### What to do?

::: .incremental
1.  Don't give up on ontologies just now
2.  Get a different perspective on the case by discussing your case with colleagues
3.  Contribute back to the community with your edge case
:::


## Contributing

Your edge case can help others!

-   Do you want to amend/extend the definition of a term?
-   No term fits your case?

Either way, you need to contact the [maintainers]{.orange} of the ontology


## Contributing new terms

-   Find the community space of the ontology (e.g., GitHub, Slack)
-   Look-up if someone has the same edge case already
-   Read the Contributing guidelines
-   Identify any request process

## Limits of standardisation

-   Sometimes ontologies are not needed [@malone_ten_2016, see Rule 10]

## A silver lining

Still, worth trying.
