## Learning objectives

-   **define** metadata and ontology in the context of biology and microbiology
-   **identify** the importance of reliable metadata in data-centric biology
-   **recognize** that FAIR is a process and that every steps count

# Modern biology

## Modern biology = big data?

## Model organisms

::: incremental
-   Standardization focuses research efforts (and funds)
-   But **does not prohibit studying different organisms**
-   [Quick start research]{.orange} on other organisms *reusing* findings in model organisms

Key to success: [curated data description]{.green}

### Outline

1.  **Why** curate data?
2.  **How** to curate data?
:::

# Why curate data?

## Data curation arguments

We curate data ...

::: incremental
1.  in order to store for long term archive
2.  to give biological context for interpretation
3.  to be able to reanalyze in the future
4.  to be scrutinized against possible misconduct
:::

## Exercise: sort arguments

**Task:**

::: incremental
-   **Arrange** the numbered arguments by importance.
    -   *Argument n°4 is the most important, then n°3, then n°2 and n°1 the least important*
-   **Report** the numbers sequence in the pad (*4321*)
-   **Compare** your ranking with the one of your neighbor
-   **Discuss** and optionally write 1-2 sentences in the pad
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
(optional) Write novel arguments in the pad and use the 0
:::

::: notes
Additional argument:

-   public funding so need to be transparent and accountable

## Question

Why is a precise description of the data or reliable metadata necessary in the case of [research data that *you* produce]{.orange}?
:::

**Arguments**:

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
1.  in order to store for long term archive
2.  to give biological context for interpretation
3.  to be able to reanalyze in the future
4.  to be scrutinized against possible misconduct
:::

## Sort arguments (2/2)

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Question

Why is a precise description of the data or reliable metadata necessary in the case of [~~research data that *you* produce~~]{.orange} [research data produced by another research group]{.green}?
:::

**Arguments**:

1.  in order to store for long term archive
2.  to give biological context for interpretation
3.  to be able to reanalyze in the future
4.  to be scrutinized against possible misconduct

# How to curate data?

## Biological context

Biology is highly contextual (few rules, many exceptions), meaning [context]{.orange} is the key point to address to make data travel across research investigations.
