## Learning objectives

-   **define** metadata and ontology in the context of biology and microbiology
-   **identify** the importance of reliable metadata in data-centric biology
-   **recognize** that FAIR is a process and every steps counts

# Introduction

## Model organisms and decontextualisation

::: {.column width="50%"}
Standardization focuses research efforts (and funds)

**But does not prohibit different organisms**

Quick start research on other organisms from findings in model organisms thanks to [decontextualisation]{.orange}

## Modern biology

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
Biology is highly contextual (few rules, many exceptions)

**Decontextualisation**

> Seeing the forest for the trees

**Recontextualisation**

> Verifying up the forest coordinates

# Your turn!

## Exercise: sort arguments

**Task:**

::: incremental
-   **Arrange** the numbered arguments by importance.
    -   *Argument n°4 is the most important, then n°3, then n°2 and n°1 the least important*
-   **Report** the numbers sequence in the pad (*4321*)
-   **Compare** your ranking with the one of your neighbor
-   **Discuss** and optionally write 1-2 sentences in the pad
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
(optional) Write novel arguments in the pad and use the 0
:::

## Sort arguments (1/2)

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Question

Why is a precise description of the data or reliable metadata necessary in the case of [research data that *you* produce]{.orange}?
:::

**Arguments**:

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
1.  in order to store for long term archive
2.  to give biological context for interpretation
3.  to be able to reanalyze in the future
4.  to be scrutinized against possible misconduct
:::

## Sort arguments (2/2)

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Question

Why is a precise description of the data or reliable metadata necessary in the case of [~~research data that *you* produce~~]{.orange} [research data produced by another research group]{.green}?
:::

**Arguments**:

1.  in order to store for long term archive
2.  to give biological context for interpretation
3.  to be able to reanalyze in the future
4.  to be scrutinized against possible misconduct

# Take-home message

## FAIR data is a process
