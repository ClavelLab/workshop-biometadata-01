## Learning objectives

-   **define** metadata and ontology in the context of biology and microbiology
-   **identify** the importance of reliable metadata in data-centric biology
-   **recognize** that FAIR is a process and that every steps count

# Modern biology

## Modern biology = big data?

## Model organisms

::: incremental
-   Standardization focuses research efforts (and funds)
-   But **does not prohibit studying different organisms**
-   [Quick start research]{.orange} on other organisms *reusing* findings in model organisms

### Outline

1.  **Why** curate data?
2.  **How** to curate data?

# Why curate data?

## Data curation arguments

We curate data ...

::: incremental
1.  in order to store for long term archive
2.  to give biological context for interpretation
3.  to be able to reanalyze in the future
4.  to be scrutinized against possible misconduct
:::

## Exercise: sort arguments

**Task:**

::: incremental
-   **Arrange** the numbered arguments by importance.
    -   *Argument n°4 is the most important, then n°3, then n°2 and n°1 the least important*
-   **Report** the numbers sequence in the pad (*4321*)
-   **Compare** your ranking with the one of your neighbor
-   **Discuss** and optionally write 1-2 sentences in the pad
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
(optional) Write novel arguments in the pad and use the 0
:::

::: notes
Additional argument:

-   public funding so need to be transparent and accountable
:::

## Sort arguments (1/2)

## Question

Why is a precise description of the data or reliable metadata necessary in the case of [research data that *you* produce]{.orange}?
:::

**Arguments**:

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
1.  in order to store for long term archive
2.  to give biological context for interpretation
3.  to be able to reanalyze in the future
4.  to be scrutinized against possible misconduct
:::

## Sort arguments (2/2)

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Question

Why is a precise description of the data or reliable metadata necessary in the case of [~~research data that *you* produce~~]{.orange} [research data produced by another research group]{.green}?
:::

**Arguments**:

1.  in order to store for long term archive
2.  to give biological context for interpretation
3.  to be able to reanalyze in the future
4.  to be scrutinized against possible misconduct

# How to curate data?

## Biological context

Biology is highly contextual (few rules, many exceptions), meaning [context]{.orange} is the key point to address to make data travel across research investigations.

## Ontology definition {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   List of terms, usually taken from the scientific literature

-   Ontology terms:

    -   have curated **textual definitions** and synonyms

    -   are arranged in a **hierarchy** from general to specific

    -   have defined **relationships** with others terms (e.g., `is_a`, `has_condition`)

    -   have persistent **identifiers**

    -   can be **cross-referenced** with other resources (ontology or not)

-   Ontology should reflect existing knowledge

## Exercise: an ontology?

**Task**: Choose one of the definitions below and, if necessary add any *missing features*.

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
An [ontology]{.orange} is:

-   A dictionary with persistent identifiers

-   A network of scientific definitions

-   A controlled vocabulary with synonyms
:::

::: notes
Formative assessment of ontology understanding

-   A dictionary with persistent identifiers (missing hierarchy of terms)

-   A network of scientific definitions (missing curation and missing identifier)

-   A controlled vocabulary with synonyms (missing definitions and missing hierarchy)

Cross references as well
:::

## How to curate data?

-   Decontextualisation [relies on ontologies]{.orange}

-   Recontextualisation?

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
> It enables users to evaluate the potential meaning of data by assessing their provenance through the [consultation of metadata]{.orange}. This is necessary to identify the value of data as evidence, thus helping to build an **interpretation of their biological significance** in a new research setting.

## Metadata definition

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
Metadata are data about the data, or a "love note to the future" [@scott_metadata_2011].
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Metadata are "[reliability labels]{.orange}" [@leonelli_data-centric_2016, p. 28]
:::

::: {.fragment .incremental}
**Types of metadata:**

-   Descriptive: what is the data? e.g., title, description

-   Structural: how the data is organized? e.g., file, collection

-   Administrative: what is the provenance? e.g., versions, license

-   Quality: How good is the data? e.g., quality rank
:::

::: notes
The categories are not fixed in marble.
:::

## Exercise: metadata

**Task**:

-   **List** 1-4 metadata that you have already encountered

-   **Write** them in the pad under one of the four types

::: aside
If someone already wrote the one you thought about, add "+1" at the end!
