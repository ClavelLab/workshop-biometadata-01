## Learning objectives

- **define** metadata and ontology in the context of biology and microbiology
- **identify** the importance of reliable metadata in data-centric biology
- **recognize** that FAIR is a process and every steps counts


# Introduction


## Model organisms and decontextualisation

Standardization focuses research efforts (and funds)

**But does not prohibit different organisms**

Quick start research on other organisms from findings in model organisms thanks to [decontextualisation]{.orange}

# Your turn!

## Exercise: sort arguments

**Task:**

::: {.incremental}

* **Arrange** the numbered arguments by importance.
  * _Argument n째4 is the most important, then n째3, then n째2 and n째1 the least important_
* **Report** the numbers sequence in the pad (_4321_)
* **Compare** your ranking with the one of your neighbor
* **Discuss** and optionally write 1-2 sentences in the pad
:::


::: {.fragment .fade-up}
(optional) Write novel arguments in the pad and use the 0
:::


## Sort arguments (1/2)

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Question
Why is a precise description of the data or reliable metadata necessary in the case of [research data that _you_ produce]{.orange}?
:::


**Arguments**:

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
1. in order to store for long term archive
2. to give biological context for interpretation
3. to be able to reanalyze in the future
4. to be scrutinized against possible misconduct

## Sort arguments (2/2)


::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Question
Why is a precise description of the data or reliable metadata necessary in the case of ~~[research data that _you_ produce]{.orange}~~ [research data produced by another research group]{.green}?

**Arguments**:

1. in order to store for long term archive
2. to give biological context for interpretation
3. to be able to reanalyze in the future
4. to be scrutinized against possible misconduct
