## About the workshop materials

The materials for the workshop is made available under the [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) via rendered presentations on the current website and the sources of the presentations on the [Gitlab of the workshop](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/clavellab/workshop-biometadata-01).

## About the website

This website, the associated pages and the presentations are generated using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) which is an open-source publishing system to craft reproducible documents.

We generated presentations in the [`revealjs` format](https://revealjs.com) format using custom theme based on [the _solarized_ theme](https://revealjs.com/themes/). Further customisation, inspired by [Emil Hvitfeldt's blog post](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/post/slidecraft-colors-fonts/), focused on:

* a readable font ([Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible) from Google), hosted locally to [comply with GDPR](https://cookie-script.com/blog/google-fonts-and-gdpr).
* sufficient contrast for text and background colors on slides and website, using [Colour Constrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/).
* a color palette in-line with our consortium and logo color palette designed using the web tool [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).
